Introduction
This documentation covers the implementation of a password generator written in Python. The program generates a specified number of passwords of user-defined lengths. Each password includes a mix of lowercase letters, at least one digit, and at least one uppercase letter to enhance security.

Code Overview
The program is structured into the following main parts:

Function Definitions
generatePassword(pwlength)
replaceWithNumber(pword)
replaceWithUppercaseLetter(pword)
Main Function
main()
Function Definitions
generatePassword(pwlength) Function
python
Copy code
import random

def generatePassword(pwlength):
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    passwords = [] 

    for i in pwlength:
        password = "" 
        for j in range(i):
            next_letter_index = random.randrange(len(alphabet))
            password = password + alphabet[next_letter_index]
        password = replaceWithNumber(password)
        password = replaceWithUppercaseLetter(password)
        passwords.append(password)
    return passwords
Purpose: Generates passwords of specified lengths.
Parameters: pwlength - a list of integers representing the lengths of the passwords to be generated.
Design Choices:
Uses the alphabet string to randomly select lowercase letters for the initial password.
Iterates through the specified lengths, generating a random password for each length.
Enhances each password by calling replaceWithNumber() and replaceWithUppercaseLetter() functions.
Challenges: Ensuring the random generation process includes a sufficient mix of characters to meet security requirements.
replaceWithNumber(pword) Function
python
Copy code
def replaceWithNumber(pword):
    for i in range(random.randrange(1, 3)):
        replace_index = random.randrange(len(pword)//2)
        pword = pword[0:replace_index] + str(random.randrange(10)) + pword[replace_index+1:]
    return pword
Purpose: Replaces one or two characters in the first half of the password with random digits.
Parameters: pword - the password string to be modified.
Design Choices:
Ensures at least one character in the first half of the password is replaced with a digit.
Uses random.randrange to determine the position of the character to be replaced.
Challenges: Balancing the replacement to ensure security without overly complicating the password structure.
replaceWithUppercaseLetter(pword) Function
python
Copy code
def replaceWithUppercaseLetter(pword):
    for i in range(random.randrange(1, 3)):
        replace_index = random.randrange(len(pword)//2, len(pword))
        pword = pword[0:replace_index] + pword[replace_index].upper() + pword[replace_index+1:]
    return pword
Purpose: Replaces one or two characters in the second half of the password with their uppercase equivalents.
Parameters: pword - the password string to be modified.
Design Choices:
Ensures at least one character in the second half of the password is replaced with an uppercase letter.
Uses random.randrange to determine the position of the character to be replaced.
Challenges: Ensuring the uppercase replacement is distributed towards the second half of the password.
Main Function
python
Copy code
def main():
    numPasswords = int(input("How many passwords do you want to generate? "))
    print("Generating " + str(numPasswords) + " passwords")
    passwordLengths = []
    print("Minimum length of password should be 3")

    for i in range(numPasswords):
        length = int(input("Enter the length of Password #" + str(i + 1) + " "))
        if length < 3:
            length = 3
        passwordLengths.append(length)
    Password = generatePassword(passwordLengths)

    for i in range(numPasswords):
        print("Password #" + str(i + 1) + " = " + Password[i])

main()
Purpose: Interacts with the user to determine the number and lengths of passwords, and displays the generated passwords.
Design Choices:
Prompts the user for the number of passwords to generate.
Ensures each password has a minimum length of 3 characters.
Collects user input for the length of each password.
Calls generatePassword() to generate the passwords and prints them.
Challenges:
Handling user input to ensure valid lengths and counts are provided.
Ensuring the application remains user-friendly and intuitive.
Detailed Explanation of Design Choices
User Interaction: The main function is designed to interact directly with the user, ensuring the program gathers the necessary information to generate the passwords. User prompts and input validations enhance the user experience.

Password Security: Each password generated contains at least one digit and one uppercase letter, adhering to common password security guidelines. The distribution of characters (lowercase, uppercase, and digits) helps create secure and varied passwords.

Randomization: The use of the random module ensures that each password is unique and unpredictable, which is crucial for security. The functions random.randrange and random.choice are used to select random characters and positions for replacements.

Modularity: The code is modular, with specific functions handling different aspects of password generation and modification. This structure makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend in the future.

Challenges and Solutions
Input Validation: Ensuring that user inputs are valid and within acceptable ranges was a key challenge. The solution was to include checks and default values (e.g., minimum password length).
Character Distribution: Balancing the inclusion of different character types (lowercase, uppercase, digits) to create secure passwords without overly complicating the logic. The solution was to separate the replacement logic into distinct functions ('replaceWithNumber' and 'replaceWithUppercaseLetter').
This documentation covers the key aspects of the password generator code, providing an overview of its functionality, design choices, and the challenges encountered during implementation.
